# Slides for [AI Academy](www.ai-academy.com) presentations.

We organize tailored workshops for professionals and businesses to spread awareness on AI's potential, as well as helping them bringing to market new AI-based products.

The slides are made using [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js). Depending on the audience of the workshop, some may be in Italian.
