## Prima applicazione di AI ristretta: 
### English-Russian translator

# Risultati:
*  English: 
* "The spirit is strong, but the flesh is weak"
* After English - Russian > Russian - English: <!-- .element class="fragment" -->
* "The whiskey is strong, but the meat is rotten" <!-- .element class="fragment" style="color:red" -->

## Primo "AI Winter" (1966 ~ 1980s):
* ### No potenza di calcolo.
* ### No dati.
* ### No metodi.

---

<!-- .slide: data-background="../images/expertsystem_guys.jpg" -->
## Secondo "AI spring":
### I sistemi esperti

---

# Problemi Expert Systems:
* ### Costosi da realizzare
* ### **Molto** settorializzati
* ### Scarsa capacità di generalizzazione

---

## Un "nuovo" approccio: il Machine Learning

# What is Machine Learning?
> «A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E»

> "Many of the papers, data sets, and software tools related to deep learning have been open sourced. [...] Software tools like Theano and TensorFlow, combined with cloud data centers for training, and inexpensive GPUs for deployment, allow small teams of engineers to build state-of-the-art AI systems."
