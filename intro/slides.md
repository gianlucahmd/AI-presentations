## Prima applicazione di AI ristretta: 
### English-Russian translator

# Risultati:

*  English: 
* "The spirit is strong, but the flesh is weak"
* After English - Russian > Russian - English: <!-- .element class="fragment" -->
* "The whiskey is strong, but the meat is rotten" <!-- .element class="fragment" style="color:red" -->

## Primo "AI Winter" (1966 ~ 1980s):
* ### No potenza di calcolo.
* ### No dati.
* ### No metodi.

---

<!-- .slide: data-background="../images/expertsystem_guys.jpg" -->
## Secondo "AI spring":
### I sistemi esperti

---

## Problemi dei Sistemi Esperti: Eliza

* I have problems with my mother What kind of problems?
	* I feel neglected...
* OK... "I feel neglected". Tell me more.
	* I feel like she doesn't like me
* Tell me more about such feelings.
	* I feel like she prefers my sister
* Do you often feel like she prefers your sister?
	* Every day
* OK... "I feel like she prefers your sister". Tell me more.

---

## Problemi dei Sistemi Esperti: Eliza

* I ate too much and my stomach hurts Can you tell me more?
	* My stomach hurts
* What does that suggest to you?
	* What does that suggest to you? We were discussing you, not me.
* I want to know your opinion
	* What would it mean to you if you got to know my opinion?
* Much
	* OK... "I want to know my opinion". Tell me more.

---

# Problemi Expert Systems:
* ### Costosi da realizzare
* ### **Molto** settorializzati
* ### Scarsa capacità di generalizzazione

---

## Scetticismo:
> *“The history of research on artificial intelligence to date has always consisted of a very limited number of successes in specific areas, followed immediately by failures in achieving the larger goals that these initial successes seemed initially suggest.”*

	> Jack Schwartz, 1987

## Un "nuovo" approccio: il Machine Learning
![](../images/ML.png)

---

## Cos'è il Machine Learning?
> "La scienza che da ai computer l'abilità di imparare senza essere programmati esplicitamente"

1959, Arthur Samuel

---

## Definizione rigorosa di ML
> "Si dice che un computer impara da un'esperienza E rispetto a una cefrta classe di compiti T e misura di performance P se le sue performance nel performare il compito T, come misurato da P, migliora con l'esperienza E."

1996, Tom M.Mitchell

## The new (last?) AI spring
> *“If one could devise a successful chess machine, one would seem
to have penetrated to the core of human intellectual endeavor”*
	> Allen Newell, 1958

# AI acquisitions, then:
* **DNNresearch** is a startup founded by Professor Geoffrey Hinton of The University of Toronto.
* **Hunch** is developing an online decision engine
* **DeepMind** is a cutting edge artificial intelligence company. The company combines the best techniques from machine learning and systems neuroscience to build powerful general-purpose learning algorithms.

---


## AI acquisitions, now:
* Wise.io is a machine-learning powered service that delivers rapid, collaborative prototyping and production deployment of advanced machine learning solutions, and helps businesses find patterns and trends in their vast data stores.
* Bit Stew Systems provides MIx Core, a platform for handling data integration, data analysis, and predictive automation for connected devices on the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT).
